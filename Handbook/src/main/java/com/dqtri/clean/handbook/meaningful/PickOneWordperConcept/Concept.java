    //it’s confusing to
    //have fetch, retrieve, and get as equivalent methods of different classes


    //Likewise, it’s confusing to have a controller and a manager and a driver in the same
    //code base. What is the essential difference between a DeviceManager and a ProtocolController? Why are both not controllers or both not managers? Are they both Drivers
    //really?


    //Don’t Pun
    //Avoid using the same word for two purposes. Using the same term for two different ideas
    //is essentially a pun.
