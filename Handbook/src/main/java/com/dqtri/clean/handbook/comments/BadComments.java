//Bad Comments
//Most comments fall into this category. Usually they are crutches or excuses for poor code
//or justifications for insufficient decisions, amounting to little more than the programmer
//talking to himself.

    //Mumbling
    //Plopping in a comment just because you feel you should or because the process requires it,
    //is a hack. If you decide to write a comment, then spend the time necessary to make sure it
    //is the best comment you can write.
