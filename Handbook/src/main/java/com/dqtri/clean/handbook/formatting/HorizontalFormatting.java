    //How wide should a line be?

    //The regularity is impressive, especially right around 45 characters.
    // Indeed, every size from 20 to 60 represents about 1 percent of the total number of lines.
    // That’s 40 percent! Perhaps another 30 percent are less than 10 characters wide.
    // Remember this is a log scale, so the linear appearance of the drop-off above 80 characters is really very significant.

    //Programmers clearly prefer short lines


    //This suggests that we should strive to keep our lines short. The old Hollerith limit of 80 is a bit arbitrary,
    //and I’m not opposed to lines edging out to 100 or even 120. But beyond that is probably just careless.
